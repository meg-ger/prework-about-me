      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello there! I'm a barbershop-singing, forever-baking, high school English and yearbook teacher.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Wichita, KS</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I sing in a female barbershop chorus and quartet. I also love to bake, especially when it calls for elaborate decorating.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I'd love to be a web developer or designer. Really I'm just looking to avoid grading any more essays.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Overland Park</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>While looking for an exciting new career, I realized that my favorite parts of teaching have always been the super detail-oriented tasks involving technology. After trying out a bit of online coding, I realized it was a great fit. </p>
